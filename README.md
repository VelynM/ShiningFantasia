# Shining Fantasia

## How to use the command line utilities (rough sketch)

1. Download and install latest Node.js LTS release, 20.10.0 LTS at the time of writing
2. From a command prompt, in the ShiningFantasia directory, run `npm install`
3. And then run `npm run build`
4. `node ./build/commands/<command>/index.js <parameters>`

## How to use the Electron application

I am undecided whether or not to keep the Electron application, so it may not exist in the future.
